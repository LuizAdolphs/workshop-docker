# Workshop Docker

Just an in-company initiative to spread Docker technology. Only available in portuguese Brazil.

Made using reveal.js and font-awesome.

Please ignore the fact that node_modules are present, I was lazy to bundle dependencies.

Execute run-windows.ps1 (need a permission in powershell) or run-linux.sh to up the Docker container and run the presentation.

After that, just http://localhost:8080(http://localhost:8080)
